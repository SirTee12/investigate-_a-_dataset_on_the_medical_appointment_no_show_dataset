<h1> Conclusion</h1>

> In the first section, relationship between hypertension and No-show was investigated and i found out that hypertension might not be the reason for patients not showing up as a large percentage of them (83%) actually showed up for appointment.

> in the second section, i investigated to see if older patient don't show up for appointment as compared to young patient and it was discovered that older people do show up as well as younger people which led to the conclusion that age might not be a factor for not showing up.

> for the third section, I investigated if women show up for appointment more than men. It was discovered that the proportion of women that showed up and those of men that showed was almost the sam with respective to the total patient for each gender. this means that gender is not a factor for not showing up.

> Looking at those with scholarship and those without, analysis showed that being on scholarship is not a factor for not showing up
